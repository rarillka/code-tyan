# Welcome to CodeIt! This minigame is designed as a puzzle
# to determine where the statements on the right go.
# 
# To insert a statement on the right, click on it, and it will
# insert at the first empty gray space.
# 
# To remove a statement from here, click on the statement, 
# but be careful: The statements may shift!
# 
# Be sure to read comments in the file; they may help you 
# figure out the correct order!
